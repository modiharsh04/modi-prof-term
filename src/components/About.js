    Hello, I am a software engineer with Master's in Computer Science. I am
    working full time as a full stack engineer and doing my second Master's
    in Management in Information Technology. I born and grew up in Ahmadabad,
    Gujarat, India. My family still lives there, and I live in Illinois, USA. I
    moved to US for doing my Master's in Computer Science in 2015. I have
    lived in Houston for 2 years where I received my graduation degree and
    then moved to the city many dreams for NYC {'<3'}, where I worked for 2+
    years in an amazing startup and learned so much and met great people. I
    then moved to Illinois and working in a networking company.

    I love traveling, being amidst nature, trying new food, doing yoga, playing
    and watching sport, experiment with new things/adventures, watching movies,
    shows, and get involved in intellectual conversations. I love being on the
    road and explore new places or food or culture but more than that I love to
    be amidst nature. I disguise myself as a life long learner, analytical,
    positive thinker, cheerful, and one who loves to spend time with family and
    friends.
